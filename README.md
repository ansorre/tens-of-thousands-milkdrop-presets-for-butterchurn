# Tens of thousands Milkdrop presets converted for the WebGL Butterchurn Milkdrop Visualizer
This is a collection of 15,056 Milkdrop presets converted in json format to be used with the WebGL Butterchurn Milkdrop Visualizer which can be found [here](https://github.com/jberg/butterchurn).    
This collection will continue to grow, I still have many thousands more presets to convert, but it's not easy. The more interest this repository will collect, the more I will devote myself to it.
